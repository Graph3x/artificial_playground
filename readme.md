This is a collection of AI models.

-TITANIC:

- A little twist on the popular Kaggle challenge. The model is trained on the Kaggle dataset of titanic survivors. You can send information to the "/" FastAPI endpoint and the model will predict whether you would survive the titanic crash or not.

I am still working on other models and a web UI to interact with them.
